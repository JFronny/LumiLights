# Lumi Lights
Aesthetic shader for [Canvas](https://github.com/grondag/canvas) that adds directional sky light and ambient light. Lumi Lights aims to replace vanilla lighting as much as possible.

Written for the latest Canvas build (new pipeline). 

## Now with wavy water
Wavy water effect is experimental and may cause artifact when: a block is mistakenly treated as water, or near the edge of 256x256 world regions due to a Canvas bug. Please report if you find other issues.
