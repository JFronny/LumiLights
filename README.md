A PBR Forward Rendering Demo Shader for Canvas. It is meant to be used with the [Lumi Lights PBR Materials Extension](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiPBRExt) for maximum effect.

## Using
Lumi Lights PBR is created with the latest version of Canvas in mind. Download the latest version of [Canvas](https://github.com/grondag/canvas/releases). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLightsPBR/issues) if Lumi Lights PBR doesn't work with the latest version of Canvas.

Once you have the latest version of Canvas installed, grab the latest release of [Lumi Lights PBR](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLightsPBR/releases) and [Lumi Lights PBR Ext](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiPBRExt/releases) and put them in your resource packs folder.
